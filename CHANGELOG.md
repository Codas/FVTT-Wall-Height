# CHANGELOG

## [1.0.0] 2020-07-07

The 1.0.0 update introduces a breaking change. Walls that have been set up with wall height will need to be set up again. [A macro](/macros/0.1.0_to_1.0.0_migration.js) is provided that can perform the migration automatically.

Despite being version 1.0.0, this module is *still* in a pre-release status. Use at your own risk.

### FIXED

- Improved performance issues with large numbers of walls.

## [0.1.0] 2020-07-05

### ADDED

- Add top and bottom height for walls.
